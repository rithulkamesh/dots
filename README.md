## Instructions for Installation

You can choose to do this one of two ways

1. By Symlinking the files in this folder to your `~/.config`
2. By Copying over the downloaded folder(s) to your `~/.config`

### Symlinking

This is the method I personally prefer.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.dots && git clone git@github.com:rithulkamesh/dots.git ~/.dots
```

and then link necessary folders as such

```bash
ln -s ~/.dots/<conf> ~/.config
```
